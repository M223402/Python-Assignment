# Python-Assignment
This repository have the python code and it description in a brief:

In this assignment, I practiced foundational Python skills by working through various tasks. I created variables of different data types and performed basic operations to understand how they work. Then, I used control structures to build a number classification program that uses loops and conditional statements. I also made a simple calculator, where I implemented functions for basic arithmetic and handled errors gracefully.

For the final task, I built a small to-do list app, organizing the project into modules for user interaction, task management, and utilities. Throughout, I practiced organizing code into functions and modules, which helped improve my understanding of modular design in Python.
